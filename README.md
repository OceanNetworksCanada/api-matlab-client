[![View Ocean Networks Canada API Client Library on File Exchange](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/images/matlab-file-exchange.svg)](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/74065-ocean-networks-canada-api-client-library)

This library facilitates access to scientific data hosted by [Ocean Networks Canada](https://oceannetworks.ca) through the
[Oceans 3.0 API](https://wiki.oceannetworks.ca/display/O2A/Oceans+3.0+API+Home) public web services.

This repository is synchronized to the [MATLAB ONC API Client Add-On](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/74065-ocean-networks-canada-api-client-library) which can be installed from the MATLAB Add-on explorer (please search for the "onc" Add-on).

## Requirements

* **MATLAB Version:** The MATLAB API client has been tested on MATLAB R2022b.
* **Possible Compatibility:** Basic unit testing on MATLAB R2018a indicates general compatibility with this version. While the client may work on versions newer than R2018a, compatibility with versions other than R2022b has not been explicitly verified.
* **Unsupported Versions:** MATLAB versions older than R2018a are not supported.
